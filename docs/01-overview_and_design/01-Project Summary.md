## Project Summary

### Introduction
Design and develop a web application for managing orders in a 3PL company. The application will be built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, focusing on flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

---

### Objectives

#### Business Goals
- **Efficiency:** Shift order entry responsibilities from internal employees to clients, allowing internal resources to focus on higher-value tasks.
- **Scalability:** Support large-scale operations, including importing and managing up to 10,000 materials or more.

#### Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** Client employees responsible for creating sales orders.
- **Secondary Users:** Super Admins managing overall configurations and Client Admins overseeing user access and settings.

---

### Architecture and Features

#### Sales Order Management
- Users can create structured sales orders by selecting recipient details, carrier types, service types, delivery dates, and materials from specific inventory.
- Support for batch/lot and serial number selection depending on client-specific configurations.
- File generation (CSV or JSON) tailored to client needs.

#### System Flow
- **Login Workflow:**
  1. Users log in through a common login page.
  2. Based on their role (`SuperAdmin`, `ClientAdmin`, or `Operator`), they are redirected to the appropriate section or URL.
- **Order Creation Workflow:**
  1. **Order Details:**
     - Input `OrderLookupCode`, Warehouse, and Shipping Address.
     - Add optional fields: PO number, Reference number, Carrier, Service Type, Expected Delivery Date, and Notes.
  2. **Inventory Selection:**
     - Display inventory and validate selected quantity.
  3. **Order Confirmation:**
     - Review and confirm order details.
     - Generate a file (CSV or JSON) based on customer configuration.
  4. **Output File Storage:**
     - Save the file to an FTP or storage solution for integration with external systems.

#### Multi-Site Management
- **Super Admins:** Manage clients, projects, users, and configurations, including feature toggles.
- **Client Admins:** Oversee user access and role-based permissions.
- **End Users:** Create and manage sales orders within defined scopes.

#### Modular Architecture
- Feature toggles to dynamically enable or disable modules.
- Common logic and reusable code isolated into dedicated modules to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

#### Multi-Tenancy
- Data segregation using `customerID` fields.
- Middleware ensures requests are scoped to authenticated customers.
- Database-level partitioning or filtering enforces strict data isolation.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Roles and permissions managed via dedicated tables.
- Middleware or decorators enforce permissions at endpoint levels.
- **Role-Based URL Access:**
  - After logging in, users are redirected to sections based on their role:
    - **SuperAdmin:** Access to global configurations.
    - **ClientAdmin:** Access to client-specific settings and user management.
    - **Operator/User:** Limited access to order creation and inventory viewing.

#### Logging and Audit Trails
- Centralized logging with metadata (e.g., timestamps, user IDs).
- Audit logs table to track critical actions.

### Tools and Technologies

#### Backend
- **Framework:** Django with Django Rest Framework (DRF) for RESTful APIs.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and scalable authentication.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Django's built-in migration framework for schema versioning.
- **File Generation:** CSV or JSON files stored in FTP or modern file storage solutions.

#### Frontend
- **Framework:** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for responsive, dynamic user interfaces.
- **State Management:** Redux or Context API for global state.

#### Deployment
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Azure, or GCP (to be determined based on cost and scalability).
- **Key Components:** Autoscaling, load balancers, and managed database services (e.g., RDS).
- **Caching:** Redis for configuration caching to boost performance.

#### Version Control and CI/CD
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub for collaborative development.
- **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow model.
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automating testing and deployment pipelines.

#### Development Environments
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for consistent environments.
- **Configuration Management:** Separate configurations for development, staging, and production.

#### Testing
- **Backend:** pytest-django for unit and integration tests.
- **Frontend:** Jest and React Testing Library for components.
- **End-to-End:** Cypress for automated user workflow testing.

#### Integration
- **API Style:** REST API for frontend-backend communication.
- **RBAC and Multi-Tenancy:** Middleware enforces role-based permissions and tenant isolation.

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Tools:** Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Sentry.
- **Monitoring:** Cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).
