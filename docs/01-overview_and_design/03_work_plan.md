## Work Plan

### Overview

This work plan outlines the tasks and phases necessary to develop the application, broken down by modules: backend, frontend, and integration. It also specifies priorities to ensure smooth progress and alignment with project goals.

---

### 1. Backend Development

#### 1.1 Database Design

- Define schema for PostgreSQL based on requirements.
  - Include support for **multi-tenancy** with `customerID` to isolate customer data.
  - Add tables for `Roles`, `Permissions`, and `FeatureFlags` to support **RBAC** and **feature toggles**.
  - Add an `AuditLogs` table to track critical actions such as order creation, user modifications, and configuration changes.
- Set up development and production environments using pgAdmin.
- Create initial migration scripts for database setup.

#### 1.2 API Development

- Design RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User management (registration, login, permissions).
  - Client and materials management.
  - Order creation and retrieval.
  - Feature toggles to enable or disable features for specific customers or projects.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) at the API level using middleware.
- Write unit tests for critical API functionality.
- Include endpoints for logging and audit trail retrieval to support compliance and debugging.

#### 1.3 Performance and Security

- Optimize database queries for scalability.
- Implement rate limiting and API monitoring.
- Add encryption for sensitive data.
- Integrate centralized logging using tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Maintain an `AuditLogs` table with metadata (e.g., timestamps, userID, affected resources) to ensure accountability.

### 2. Frontend Development

#### 2.1 UI Design

- Finalize wireframes for critical pages (dashboard, order creation, etc.).
- Develop reusable components using React.
- Implement responsive design for compatibility across devices.

#### 2.2 Integration with Backend

- Consume RESTful APIs for data display and user interactions.
- Handle error states and loading indicators effectively.
- Reflect feature availability based on backend-configured **feature toggles**.

#### 2.3 Testing and Feedback

- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with sample users.
- Iterate on feedback to improve UI/UX.

---

### 3. Integration and Testing

#### 3.1 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Set up CI/CD pipeline with tools like GitHub Actions.
- Automate deployment to staging and production environments.

#### 3.2 Integration Testing

- Test communication between frontend and backend.
- Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure data consistency.

#### 3.3 End-to-End Testing

- Verify complete workflows such as user registration and order processing.
- Use tools like Cypress or Playwright for automated testing.

### 4. Future Enhancements

- **AI Recommendations:** Incorporate machine learning models for order suggestions based on past behavior.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Implement WebSocket or similar technologies.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide insights into order trends and performance metrics.
