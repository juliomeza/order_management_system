## Testing

### Testing Strategy
Implement a robust testing strategy using `pytest-django` for both unit and integration tests. The testing approach should cover:

1. **Model Validations:**
   - Ensure all models enforce data integrity. For instance:
     - A `Customer` must have at least one associated project.
     - Fields like `email`, `name`, and `phone` meet defined constraints (e.g., format, uniqueness).

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Validate CRUD operations across all API endpoints.
   - Test role-based access control (RBAC) to confirm permissions align with user roles.
   - Verify authentication mechanisms (e.g., token expiration, invalid credentials).

3. **Advanced Functionalities:**
   - Test feature toggles for enabling/disabling specific features per project.
   - Ensure logging captures critical events without exposing sensitive information.
   - Validate system behavior under various configurations.

4. **Multi-Tenancy:**
   - Ensure data isolation between customers using a `customerID` field for segmentation.
   - Validate middleware enforces scoping of requests to the authenticated customer.
   - Test database partitioning or filtering for performance and isolation.

5. **Logging and Audit:**
   - Confirm logs capture all critical events with appropriate metadata (e.g., timestamps, userID).
   - Validate audit trails track CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE actions with timestamps and user attribution.
   - Ensure logs comply with retention policies and do not expose sensitive data.

### Test Case Categories
Organize the tests into distinct categories to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Validate individual functions or methods.
   - Example: A `create_customer()` function correctly returns a `Customer` instance with valid data and raises errors for invalid inputs.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test how components interact, such as models with the database or APIs with the authentication system.

3. **Regression Tests:**
   - Ensure no new code changes break existing functionality.
   - Automate these tests to run before every deployment.

4. **Performance Tests:**
   - Measure response times of critical endpoints under load.
   - Example: API endpoint `/customers` should handle 100 requests per second without significant latency.

5. **Security Tests:**
   - Ensure proper validation of user inputs to prevent SQL injection or XSS.
   - Test secure storage and transmission of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens).

### Critical Test Cases
Below are examples of high-priority test cases:

1. **Model Validations:**
   - Create a `Customer` with valid and invalid data, ensuring the appropriate error messages are raised.
   - Validate relationships:
     - Assign projects and warehouses to customers.
     - Ensure cascading deletes and updates work as expected.

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Test `POST /customers`:
     - With valid data: Expect a 201 Created status and correct payload in the response.
     - With invalid data: Expect a 400 Bad Request status and detailed error messages.
   - Test `GET /customers/{id}` for:
     - Valid customer ID: Returns 200 with the customerâ€™s details.
     - Invalid ID: Returns 404 Not Found.

3. **Feature Toggles:**
   - Verify toggles enable/disable specific project features dynamically without a restart.
   - Test default states for new features when toggles are undefined.

4. **Multi-Tenancy:**
   - Validate each customer only accesses their own data, projects, and warehouses.
   - Test middleware to ensure requests are scoped appropriately to the authenticated customer.

5. **Logging and Audit:**
   - Confirm critical actions (e.g., customer creation, project deletion) are logged.
   - Validate audit logs include essential metadata such as action, user, entity, and timestamps.

### Tools and Best Practices
- Use `pytest` fixtures to streamline test setup and teardown.
- Mock external dependencies, such as third-party APIs, for isolated testing.
- Integrate test coverage tools (e.g., `pytest-cov`) to identify untested code paths.
- Schedule automated test runs in CI/CD pipelines to maintain consistent quality.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement property-based testing for more extensive edge case discovery.
- Add UI testing for the front-end (e.g., using tools like Cypress or Selenium) to complement backend tests.
- Regularly review and update test cases as the application evolves.
