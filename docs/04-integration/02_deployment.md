## INTEGRATION: Deployment

### Introduction

Deployment is the final step in delivering a frontend application to end-users. A well-executed deployment ensures performance, scalability, and security while providing a seamless experience for users. This document outlines the best practices and steps for deploying a frontend application.

### Deployment Strategy

#### 1. **Build Optimization**
- Use tools like Vite or Webpack to create production-ready builds.
- Minify JavaScript, CSS, and assets to reduce load times.
- Use lazy loading for non-critical assets.
- Generate source maps for debugging in production.

#### 2. **Environment Configuration**
- Store environment-specific variables in `.env` files (e.g., API endpoints, keys).
- Avoid committing sensitive information to version control by using tools like `.env` or AWS Secrets Manager.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=your-key
  ```

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. **Set Up a Cloud Server**
- Use a cloud provider such as **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, or **Azure**.
- Provision a server or use managed services like AWS Amplify or Netlify for static sites.

#### 2. **Install a Web Server**
- Use **Nginx** or **Apache** to serve the application.
- Configure the server to redirect all routes to `index.html` (single-page applications).
  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.com;

      root /var/www/html;
      index index.html;

      location / {
          try_files $uri /index.html;
      }
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Configure HTTPS**
- Use **Letâ€™s Encrypt** or another SSL provider to secure the site with HTTPS.
- Automate certificate renewal using tools like Certbot.

#### 4. **Custom Domains**
- Register a domain via providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.
- Update the domain's DNS settings to point to the server's IP address.
- Configure subdomains or additional records (e.g., CNAME, A record).

#### 5. **Deploy Application**
- Transfer the build folder to the server using tools like SCP or rsync:
  ```bash
  scp -r build/ user@your-server-ip:/var/www/html
  ```
- Restart the web server to apply changes.

#### 6. **Continuous Deployment**
- Automate deployments using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
- Example GitHub Actions Workflow:
  ```yaml
  name: Frontend Deployment

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build the application
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to server
        run: scp -r build/ user@your-server-ip:/var/www/html
  ```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### 1. **Performance Monitoring**
- Use tools like Google Lighthouse or WebPageTest to analyze site performance.
- Monitor real-time metrics using services like AWS CloudWatch or New Relic.

#### 2. **Error Tracking**
- Integrate tools like Sentry to capture and monitor application errors.

#### 3. **Scaling**
- Use CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to distribute assets globally and reduce latency.
- Leverage auto-scaling features provided by cloud providers for handling traffic spikes.

### Best Practices

1. **Secure Application**:
   - Use HTTPS for all connections.
   - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

2. **Automate Deployments**:
   - Use CI/CD pipelines for consistent and repeatable deployments.

3. **Optimize Static Assets**:
   - Use modern formats like WebP for images.

4. **Test Deployments**:
   - Verify every deployment in a staging environment before pushing to production.
