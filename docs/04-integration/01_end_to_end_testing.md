## INTEGRATION: End-to-End Testing

### Introduction

End-to-End (E2E) testing verifies the complete functionality of an application by simulating real-world user scenarios. These tests ensure that the frontend and backend communicate effectively and that all components function together seamlessly in real scenarios.

---

### Goals of E2E Testing

1. **Verify Full Workflow**:
   - Ensure that multi-step processes, such as user registration, order creation, or checkout, function as expected.
2. **Validate Integration**:
   - Confirm proper communication between the frontend and backend APIs.
3. **Catch Regression Issues**:
   - Identify unintended behavior caused by new changes in the application.
4. **Ensure Real-World Functionality**:
   - Test under conditions similar to production environments.

---

### Tools and Frameworks

1. **Cypress**:
   - Easy-to-use and developer-friendly E2E testing framework.
   - Real-time browser interaction and debugging tools.
2. **Playwright**:
   - Supports multiple browsers and provides flexible testing capabilities.
   - Ideal for cross-browser testing.
3. **TestCafe**:
   - Simple syntax and minimal configuration.

For this project, **Cypress** is recommended due to its extensive documentation, fast setup, and real-time debugging.

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Install Cypress**:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```

2. **Configure Cypress**:
   - Add scripts to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "cypress:open": "cypress open",
       "cypress:run": "cypress run"
     }
     ```
   - Define base URL in `cypress.config.js`:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       e2e: {
         baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
       },
     };
     ```

### Key Test Scenarios

#### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Objective**: Verify login and logout flows.
- **Steps**:
  - Navigate to the login page.
  - Enter valid credentials and submit.
  - Validate redirection to the dashboard.
  - Log out and confirm redirection to the login page.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  describe('User Authentication', () => {
    it('should log in and log out successfully', () => {
      cy.visit('/login');
      cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('user@example.com');
      cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
      cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
      cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
      cy.get('button[aria-label="Logout"]').click();
      cy.url().should('include', '/login');
    });
  });
  ```

#### 2. **Order Placement**
- **Objective**: Validate multi-step order creation.
- **Steps**:
  - Add items to the cart.
  - Proceed to checkout.
  - Enter shipping and payment details.
  - Submit the order and verify confirmation.

#### 3. **Role-Based Access**
- **Objective**: Ensure UI and actions vary by user roles.
- **Steps**:
  - Log in as different roles (e.g., admin, customer).
  - Validate visible menu options and actions.

#### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Objective**: Verify the application's behavior under failure scenarios.
- **Steps**:
  - Simulate API failures using mocks.
  - Validate error messages and fallback behavior.

### Best Practices

1. **Write Independent Tests**:
   - Each test should run independently without relying on others.
2. **Use Mocks and Fixtures**:
   - Mock API responses to simulate specific conditions and improve test reliability.
3. **Test Critical Paths First**:
   - Prioritize testing for core workflows such as login, checkout, and data submission.
4. **Run Tests in CI/CD**:
   - Automate E2E tests in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.

### Example CI/CD Integration

1. **GitHub Actions**:
   ```yaml
   name: E2E Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     e2e:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
         with:
           node-version: 16
       - run: npm install
       - run: npm run cypress:run
   ```

2. **Reports and Logs**:
   - Use Cypress Dashboard or similar tools for detailed reporting and debugging.
